# Advanced WYSIWYG Editor for ClassicPress 1.x.x
The **WYSIWYG Advanced** plugin adds lots of additional options to the ClassicPress visual editor. This plugin is a fork of [TinyMCE Advanced v4.8](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/) for WordPress and contains no Gutenberg code.

# Pre-Installation
If you already have TinyMCE Advanced installed, you will need to deactivate and delete it before installing WYSIWYG Advanced. You might try exporting your settings from TinyMCE Advanced beforehand and importing them into WYSIWYG Advanced once you get it installed, however, this has not been tested yet.

# Installation
1. Download the [package](https://github.com/johnalarcon/wysiwyg-advanced/archive/master.zip) to your local computer.
2. Navigate to `Dashboard > Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin` and upload the file you downloaded.
3. Install, then activate.
4. Settings are located under `Dashboard > Tools > WYSIWYG`

# Compatibility
Compatible with ClassicPress 1.x.x. It should also continue to work on WordPress 4.9.x installations without any problem. PHP 7.3 ready.

# Contributing
