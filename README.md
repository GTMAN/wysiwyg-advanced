# Advanced WYSIWYG Editor for ClassicPress 1.x.x
The **WYSIWYG Advanced** plugin adds lots of additional options to the ClassicPress visual editor. This plugin is a fork of [TinyMCE Advanced v4.8](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/) for WordPress and contains no Gutenberg code. After installing the plugin, go to:

> Dashboard > Settings > WYSIWYG

# Compatibility
The plugin has been forked with ClassicPress in mind, but, it should continue to work on WordPress 4.9.x installations without any problem. PHP 7.3 ready.
